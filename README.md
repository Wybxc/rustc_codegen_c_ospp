# Rustc Codegen C

[![CI](https://github.com/Wybxc/rustc_codegen_c/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Wybxc/rustc_codegen_c/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This a C codegen backend for rustc, which lowers Rust MIR to C code and compiles
by C compiler.

The project is at very early stage. Most of the code is not implemented yet.

## Try it

In the root directory of the project, run the following command:

```bash
./y rustc example/example.rs
./build/example
```

The usage of `./y` can be viewed from `./y help`.

Note: only Linux is supported at the moment. `clang` is required to compile C code, 
and LLVM FileCheck is required to test the codegen.
